# Creator Engagement App

## The "Blast Off" Button for Your Content

The Creator Engagement App is designed to help content creators get the crucial initial engagement they need right when they go live or publish new content.

### The Problem

Many new and growing content creators struggle to notify their audience effectively across all platforms the moment new content drops. This initial window is critical for algorithms and for building momentum.

### The Solution

This app provides a simple, one-touch "blast off" button that creators can press right before going live or publishing. It will send out pre-configured announcements to their selected social channels, letting their audience know it's time to engage.

## Features (Planned)

*   Connect multiple social media accounts (Twitter, Discord, etc.).
*   Customize "blast off" message templates.
*   A simple, one-button interface to send announcements.
*   Analytics to track click-through rates from announcements.
